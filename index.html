        <p class="  p-color">
            Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
            accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing
            cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is

            produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of
            Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

        <p class="  p-color">
            Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as
            Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor
            characteristics
            of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known species of coffee
            grown
            are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia
            is S.795.

        <h2 class="fs-2 fw-bold bg-color text-uppercase  text-center ">Ethiopia</h2>
        <p class="  p-color">
            Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha. Longberry
            varieties
            consist of the largest beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value and
            flavor.
            Shortberry varieties are smaller. The Mocha variety is a highly prized commodity. Mocha Harars are
            known
            for their peaberry beans that often have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.
